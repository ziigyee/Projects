Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc  In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation  A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc  is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance     Unsupervised Deep Learning  Towards 10X fewer labeled samples  Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible  The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples  This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data     Deep Learning on Embedded Devices  Towards 100X smaller models  Current deep learning models have10 s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware  The aim is to achieve models that are I00x smaller, with little loss in performance  This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state of the art deep learning models     Online Deep Learning  Towards Near Real Time  NRT  model updates  State of the art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure  A common problem is when new data  including new classes  are constantly added to an evolving, always  learning system  Algorithms to move towards real time updates will be essential     Extreme Deep Learning  Training lB neural networks efficiently  The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing   amounts of data and model   size improves performance  However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently  The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training     Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding  Towards better modeling of human communication   Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation  However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning  This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players     White Box Deep Learning  Towards interpretable and contextually informed models  Current deep learning models are largely black boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition  Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications    especially for complex learning scenarios and appl ications involving critical decisions     Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning  Towards better understanding of images  Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of   bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence level associations  Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy     Job Requirements      PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas                        1  Large scale machine learning                      2  Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised                      3  Applying state of art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains    Experience in corporate or application orientated environments is a plus    Ability to work independently, as well as in teams highly desired    Good communication skills for proposals, reports, and publications    Proficiency in spoken and written English    Experience with one of Tensor Flow, Theano, Caffee, CNTK    Strong programming abilities  e g  Perl, Bash, C/C++, Java, Python, R, MATLAB    Computer vision and deep learning skills desirable    The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive  A*STAR may include additional selection criteria based on its prevailing recruitment policies  These policies may be amended from
