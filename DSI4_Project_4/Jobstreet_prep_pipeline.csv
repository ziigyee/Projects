MIT, Stanford and CMU     Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Leaming 2 0 project       Multimodal Deep Learning  Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources  Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc  In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation  A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc  is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance        Unsupervised Deep Learning  Towards 10X fewer labeled samples  Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible  The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples  This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data        Deep Learning on Embedded Devices  Towards 100X smaller models  Current deep learning models have !Os of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware  The aim is to achieve models that are I OOx smaller, with little loss in performance  This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state of the art deep learning models        Online Deep Learning  Towards Near Real Time  NRT  model updates  State of the art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure  A common problem is when new data  including new classes  are constantly added to an evolving, always  learning system  Algorithms to move towards real time updates will be essential        Extreme Deep Learning  Training lB neural networks efficiently  The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing   amounts of data and model   size improves performance  However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently  The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training        Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding  Towards better modeling of human communication  Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation  However, there are still numerous challenges
